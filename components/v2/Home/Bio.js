        Previously, I worked at{" "}

        agency based out of Cheltenham - where I spent most of my time
        designing, prototyping and building web/mobile apps for companies
        spanning multiple industries from Telecoms to VR.

        I enjoy writing code, but my passion is in building useful products. I
        love sweating the details of a design and making each interaction as
        smooth and effortless as possible.
